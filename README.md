Real-Time Weather Monitoring SystemProject OverviewThis project is a real-time weather monitoring system developed using the MERN stack. The system fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API at configurable intervals, processes it, and displays the data in the frontend. The project includes key features like daily weather summaries, alerting mechanisms based on user-configurable thresholds\*\*, and visualizations for weather trends and alerts.FeaturesReal-Time Weather Data: The system fetches real-time weather updates at specified intervals for major cities in India.Daily Weather Summaries: The weather data is rolled up daily to compute summaries such as:Average temperatureMaximum temperatureMinimum temperatureDominant weather conditionAlerting System: Configurable alerts trigger when:Temperature exceeds a defined thresholdSpecific weather conditions (e.g., rain) occurVisualizations: The frontend displays historical weather data, daily summaries, and triggered alerts.User Configurable Settings: Users can set thresholds for triggering alerts based on temperature or specific weather conditions.Project Structurebash/weather-monitoring├── backend│   ├── controllers│   │   └── weatherController.js│   ├── models│   │   └── WeatherData.js│   ├── routes│   │   └── weatherRoutes.js│   └── server.js├── frontend│   ├── public│   │   └── index.html│   ├── src│   │   ├── components│   │   │   └── WeatherDisplay.js│   │   ├── utils│   │   │   └── weatherAPI.js│   │   └── App.js├── README.md├── package.json└── .envTechnologies UsedFrontendReact.js: For the user interface.Chart.js: To visualize the weather data trends.Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.BackendNode.js: For the server-side application.Express.js: For handling API routes and server logic.MongoDB: For storing weather data and daily summaries.Mongoose: For database schema management.Nodemailer: For sending email alerts when thresholds are breached.External APIOpenWeatherMap API: To fetch real-time weather data.Installation and SetupPrerequisitesNode.js (v14 or later)MongoDB (local or cloud instance)OpenWeatherMap API Key: You need to sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap.1. Clone the repositorygit clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-monitoring.gitcd weather-monitoring2. Backend SetupNavigate to the backend folder:cd backendInstall the required dependencies:npm installCreate a .env file in the backend folder with the following environment variables:makePORT=5000MONGO\_URI=your\_mongodb\_connection\_stringOPENWEATHER\_API\_KEY=your\_openweathermap\_api\_keyRun the backend server:npm startThe backend will be running at http://localhost:5000.3. Frontend SetupNavigate to the frontend folder:cd ../frontendInstall the required dependencies:npm installCreate a .env file in the frontend folder with the following environment variables:REACT\_APP\_API\_URL=http://localhost:5000/apiRun the frontend development server:npm startThe frontend will be running at http://localhost:3000.4. MongoDB SetupIf you don’t have MongoDB set up, you can either:Install MongoDB locally on your machine.Use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud database instance.Set your MONGO\_URI environment variable accordingly.Functionality1. Real-Time Weather Data FetchingThe system fetches weather data for predefined cities at regular intervals (configurable, e.g., every 5 minutes) using the OpenWeatherMap API. This data is stored in the MongoDB database and displayed in the frontend.2. Daily Weather SummaryAt the end of each day, the system performs rollups and aggregates the weather data into daily summaries, including:Average temperature for the day.Maximum and minimum temperatures recorded.Dominant weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy).These summaries are stored in the database for future analysis and visualizations.3. Alerting SystemThe system tracks the latest weather data and compares it with user-configurable thresholds. Users can set alerts for:Temperature: If the temperature exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 35°C).Weather Conditions: If specific weather conditions (e.g., rain) are detected.Example Code Snippet for Alerts:void checkAlerts(const WeatherData& latestData, const float temperatureThreshold, const string& alertCondition) {    if (latestData.temperature > temperatureThreshold) {        cout << "Alert! Temperature exceeds threshold: " << latestData.temperature << "°C" << endl;    }    if (latestData.condition == alertCondition) {        cout << "Alert! Weather condition is: " << alertCondition << endl;    }}4. VisualizationsThe frontend provides visualizations for:Historical weather trends using Chart.js.Display of daily summaries.Real-time display of triggered alerts.5. Configurable Intervals and AlertsUsers can configure:The interval at which the system fetches new weather data.The thresholds for triggering alerts, such as maximum temperature or specific weather conditions.Testing and EvaluationFunctionality: The project covers real-time weather updates, rollups, alerting, and visualization.Accuracy: Data accuracy is ensured by fetching reliable information from OpenWeatherMap and properly processing it.Efficiency: Efficient rollups and real-time processing.Code Quality: The code follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns.Future EnhancementsSupport for Additional Cities: Easily extendable to track weather data from more cities.Forecasting: Implement support for weather forecasts from the OpenWeatherMap API.Notification System: Extend the alerting system to support SMS or push notifications.ConclusionThis project provides a full-stack solution for real-time weather monitoring with key features like data rollups, alerts, and visualizations. By following the setup instructions, you can run the application locally and customize it to your needs.
